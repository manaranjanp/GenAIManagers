Ensuring that any retaliation is taken seriously and investigated is also crucial.</td>\n","      <td>0.843444</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-buttons\">\n","\n","  <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-83aa7673-3fa1-419e-9125-a8007ce76b1c')\"\n","            title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","            style=\"display:none;\">\n","\n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\" viewBox=\"0 -960 960 960\">\n","    <path d=\"M120-120v-720h720v720H120Zm60-500h600v-160H180v160Zm220 220h160v-160H400v160Zm0 220h160v-160H400v160ZM180-400h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160ZM180-180h160v-160H180v160Zm440 0h160v-160H620v160Z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","    </button>\n","\n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-buttons div {\n","      margin-bottom: 4px;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","    <script>\n","      const buttonEl =\n","        document.querySelector('#df-83aa7673-3fa1-419e-9125-a8007ce76b1c button.colab-df-convert');\n","      buttonEl.style.display =\n","        google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?

Our aim is not to draw comparisons or conclusions \n","about experiences of employees from marginalized racial and ethnic groups in different countries, but \n","instead to show that racism and the systems that support racism exist globally.\n","We surveyed over 5,000 employees from marginalized racial and ethnic groups in Australia, Canada, \n","New Zealand, South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Of this group, 2,637 employees \n","reported experiencing racism in their current jobs.

Two-thirds of these \\nemployees reported experiencing racism during their career, and half have experienced racism in \\ntheir current job. These employees told us about all the insidious ways they experience racism at work, \\nwhich can come from any and every direction—from superiors, colleagues, and customers; from women \\nand men; from White people and people from marginalized racial and ethnic groups. It can take the \\nform of being passed over for a promotion, being paid less, and being excluded from advancement \\nopportunities. Racism at work also means being targeted with slurs and stereotypes, as well as derisive \\ncomments about physical features, dress, and food.\\nTo understand racism at work, it is crucial to recognize that it is deeply embedded into organizational \\nsystems and structures. Therefore, combatting it means focusing on both the behavior of individuals \\nwho do and say racist things and the systems and structures that enable and even encourage the \\nbehavior in the first place., CATALYST.ORG How Racism Shows Up at Work and the Antiracist Actions Your Organization Can Take | 17\\nConsequences of Racist Experiences\\nAs these data show, inequities in promotion, pay, working conditions, and work experiences are not \\nonly a manifestation of racism but also an outcome of racism.

Some wrote about the emotional \\ntoll (e.g., feeling demeaned, unsafe, afraid, threatened), and others noted that they simply weren’t \\ncomfortable sharing their story even in the anonymous survey.\\nThese responses align with previous Catalyst research on Emotional Tax, the experience of being on \\nguard against bias against race, ethnicity, and gender and the associated effects on well-being and \\nability to thrive at work.20 Within the context of so much racist hostility, it is unsurprising that our prior \\nresearch finds that 61% of employees from marginalized racial and ethnic groups are on guard against \\nbias from their coworkers.21 In addition, there is a large body of research on the physical and mental \\nhealth effects of racism and discrimination and correlations with poor health outcomes which include \\nheart disease, high blood pressure, higher body-mass index (BMI) and obesity, cardiovascular disease, \\npoor sleep, stress hormone deregulation, inflammation, and many psychiatric disorders.22\\nI was very upset.

When the workplace \\nclimate condones and ignores all the ways White defaults are upheld through racist acts, employees \\nare harmed. Overt and covert harassment must be addressed, but to really make a difference, \\norganizations must also create a climate of respect in which all employees feel they are valued and \\nworthy as human beings—no matter their culture.23 And when racism does occur, accountability is key.\\nClimate of Harassment\\n 9 A “harassment climate” describes an organization’s \\nattitude toward inappropriate behavior—whether \\nor not protections are in place for employees who \\nexperience harassment, they feel safe reporting it, and \\nperpetrators are punished.\\n 9 Decrease harassment climate by creating \\norganizational policies to combat racism and ensuring \\nthat leaders demonstrate their commitment to \\naddressing racism. Research shows that positive \\nperceptions around antiracist leader efforts and \\norganizational policies predict decreased experiences \\nof racial and ethnic harassment and discrimination.24\\nClimate of Respect\\n 9 Take steps to encourage a respectful workplace, in \\nwhich employees are not only not harassed but also \\ntreated civilly and with dignity. Research finds that a \\nclimate of respect predicts fewer racist experiences \\neven when controlling for climate of harassment.25\\n 9 Train all employees on the importance of a respectful \\nclimate so everyone can contribute to creating a \\nworkplace free of racism.26\\n 9 Make sure “respect” is not weaponized to silence \\npeople who are raising valid and possibly \\nuncomfortable issues related to racism, White norms, \\nand equity at work.27\\nAccountability\\n 9  Create a clear process for addressing racism \\nwhen it occurs in your workplace, including a \\nmechanism to report racist and discriminatory \\nincidents anonymously,28 guidelines for investigating, \\nconsequences that will be enforced, and a \\ncommitment to timely resolution of issues. Consider \\nhiring an organizational ombuds who can be a \\nresource for employees who want to report racial or \\nother discrimination.29\\n 9  Ensure that any attempts at retaliation are also taken \\nseriously and investigated., CATALYST.ORG How Racism Shows Up at Work and the Antiracist Actions Your Organization Can Take | 5\\nIntro Key Findings Report Catalyst  \\nSolution Authors Methodology Acknowledgments Endnotes\\nBecause we gave survey respondents an open-ended prompt to describe the racism \\nthey’ve experienced in their current job, they were free to describe what happened \\nin as much or little detail as they wanted.

Three key solutions include:\\n\\n1. **Challenge White Defaults at Work**: This involves creating a workplace climate that respects all races, ethnicities, and cultures equally, addressing both overt and covert harassment, and ensuring accountability when racism occurs.\\n\\n2. **Create a Climate of Respect**: Encourage a respectful workplace where employees are treated with dignity and civility. Training all employees on the importance of a respectful climate is essential to fostering an environment free of racism.\\n\\n3. **Establish Accountability Mechanisms**: Develop clear processes for addressing racism, including anonymous reporting mechanisms, guidelines for investigation, and consequences for racist behavior. Ensuring that any retaliation is taken seriously and investigated is also crucial.   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              reference  \\\n","0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The aim of the study is to better understand how racism prevails in workplaces and highlight the organizational and systemic factors that contribute to the issue.   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                            Racism at work can mean being passed over for a promotion, being paid less, and being excluded from advancement opportunities due to the individual belonging to marginalised racial and ethnic groups.

When the workplace \\nclimate condones and ignores all the ways White defaults are upheld through racist acts, employees \\nare harmed. Overt and covert harassment must be addressed, but to really make a difference, \\norganizations must also create a climate of respect in which all employees feel they are valued and \\nworthy as human beings—no matter their culture.23 And when racism does occur, accountability is key.\\nClimate of Harassment\\n 9 A “harassment climate” describes an organization’s \\nattitude toward inappropriate behavior—whether \\nor not protections are in place for employees who \\nexperience harassment, they feel safe reporting it, and \\nperpetrators are punished.\\n 9 Decrease harassment climate by creating \\norganizational policies to combat racism and ensuring \\nthat leaders demonstrate their commitment to \\naddressing racism. Research shows that positive \\nperceptions around antiracist leader efforts and \\norganizational policies predict decreased experiences \\nof racial and ethnic harassment and discrimination.24\\nClimate of Respect\\n 9 Take steps to encourage a respectful workplace, in \\nwhich employees are not only not harassed but also \\ntreated civilly and with dignity.

Training all employees on the importance of a respectful climate is essential to fostering an environment free of racism.\\n\\n3. **Establish Accountability Mechanisms**: Develop clear processes for addressing racism, including anonymous reporting mechanisms, guidelines for investigation, and consequences for racist behavior.
